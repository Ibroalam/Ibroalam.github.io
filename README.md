# Disaster management in Lpu
# Introduction
Disasters, both natural and man-made, have been a terrible and repeating reality throughout human's history. From earthquakes to floods, they pose a threat to human life and are the causes of environmental damage as well as loss of human life.. Therefore, disaster management is an indespensible aspect of modern society.

The importance of disaster management cannot be overstated, was ist plays a crucial viole minimizing the loss of life and property. Lovely Professional University (LPU) recognizes. the need of disaster management and takes necessary steps to ensure a safe and resilient icampus environment.

LPU has a comprehensive disaster management Plan in place to deal with variety of disasters. With Disaster Management Cell (DMC) responsible for the planning, icollaboration and perpetration of measures. Handled by well equipped professional Necessary precautions are taken along with training sessions and drills to ensure a well prepared. scsponse in case of a sudden icalamity.
LPU Campus Disaster Management can down into four primary stages. broken 3/9

1. PRE-DISASTER PHASE :

In this phase, steps are the threat of such as → taken to alleviate a disaster. It includes activites

(Risk) •Thouat Assesment: It us the approach to determine the nature and extent of disaster. management by analysing potential hazards and evaluating existing conditions.

Risk Reduction: It is the implementations of policies and procedures to reduce the rusk of existing disasters and manage the risks of Memaining disasters to reduce losses.

•Disaster Preparedness : The actions taken in advance to prepare for, respond to from the affects of a disaster. and recover

2. DISASTER PHASE:

Response addresses providing relief to the affected people which includes saving lives. meeting humanitation needs, clean up, damage assessment.

3- POST DISASTER PHASE:

It is defined as stragies to assist va community in rebuilding after disasters.

# Methodology

Disaster Management is a systematic process that involve various phasies and methodologis to prepare for and mitigate seespond to the disasters,

PREVENTION AND MITIGATION :-

• Identify risks assess and distinguish potential dangers and risks in the area. including natural disasters (earthquake, floods etc ) and manmade disasters (eg industrial accidents etc),

Risk Reduction Measures :-

Implement measures to reduce the impact of the disasters such as land use planning, hazard specific engineering solutions.

Public awareness - Educate the public about disaster risks and promote safety. measures, including evacuation plans, early warning systems and disaster preparedness.

PREPAREDNESS:-

•Emergency Plans:- Before a disaster strikes, It is important to have emergency plans. within communities and organizations.

•Resource Stockpiling - vresources should be inequoted and maintained do nALUCE in clean and unsy access to necessary resources during a disaster at includes stock of necessary amenities foed water, medical supplies etc.

draining and ExoMCLDE: To ensure that everyone is prepared, training and accicises should be conducted to su that the people. are ready incase a disaster strikes.

RESPONSE :-

activating emergency response teams and coordination centres when a disaster Оссurs

Search and Rescue: Send rescue teams to save
people and provide immediate assistance required.

Communication : establishing effective communication systems to coordinate response efforts and provide information to the public.

Transportation and Resource Management - Managin transportation and logistics to support response operation


DISASTER MANAGEMENT IN INDIA - A STATUS REPORT:-

India is considered vulnerable to hazards on account of its unique geo-climatic conditieru. About 60% of the land mass in India is prone to earthquakes, while about 5% of total area is prone to cyclone and about 68% of the area is susceptible to drought. Though, the country has made scientific progress
The loss of life and property has not decreased. The government of Initia has brought a shift in the approach to diastes management. The new approach proceeds from the convict on that develop- merd cannot be sustainble imbies diesels mitt gation usbuilt frito a development process!

The acenomic dossess that one wardry. faces from disasters have a direct impact on the development process as it as not only costly but also hinders the growth projects in a country.

2. PRINCIPLES OF EMERGENCY PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT:-

David Alexander discussed general procedures, methods, protocols and strategies of emergency planning on 31 covers essential topics including, I wase of maps, analytical techniques and modeling of disasters. I'm his book, which was published in 2008, he talks about a comprehensive, systematic and concise introduction to effective preparation for disaster. He believe that the government (local and higher levels) are the bedrock of emergency planning and should coordinate to execute the plans. A plan orequires highly qualified planners. and must conform to appropriate lows.

HYOGO FRAMEWORK FOR ACTION:-

The Hyogo drameigns for Action (MFA) was launched en e the world Duastas Reduction (INCDR) in aoos. It was supported by 168 member state. The Hyogo Declaration outagusad the inbunaic selationship between disaster reduction, sustainable development and poverty eradication.

Creating awareness and educating the students about the potential rusks faced during a disaster and measures or precautions that must be taken al such a time.

Conducting training sessions and drills to ensure that the students are well- prepared and ready to act quickly in case a disaster strikes.

LPU is equipped with modon Technology devices to enhance disaster management capabilitus. It is well-equipped with fire-fighting supplements, medical aid, emergency exit and evacuation routes.

Research and innovation in the disaster management as given a special emphasis to explore and experiment with solutions and technology in response to disasters.

In conclusion, we have examined the Emportance.
of disaster management and its various aspects
Analyzing the response and sucovery efforts have helped in identifying the strength. and weaknesses of the security strategy. It helps in understanding the points where more emphasis is to be laid. It also helps hundurulanding the different phases during a disaster and steps that need to be taken at such a time and how one should be prepared to face it.
